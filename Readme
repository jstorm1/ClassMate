Program Synopsis:	This is the rudimentary beginings of a project to not only assist students in keeping track
			of their classes, assignments, and curriculum but to also assist them in their assignments
			as well. By creating a database of their classes and assignments and allowing them to keep 				scrap notes for their research of the assignments as well as make notes of their own. 			Another future feature might be allowing students to add in other classmates and their 
			contact information so that they might collaborate on class projects. This is the initial 
			stage for this program. The second stage will making their information available through 
			a web page and then ultimately to a mobile app that they can access and utilize the 
			application.
